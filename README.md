### Selected Topic:

The factors that drive CO2 emissions, specifically GDP per capita and life expectancy

### Reason for selecting this topic:

Climate change in the form of rising temperatures is the most pressing issue the world faces today. Greenhouse gasses, such as carbon and methane, are most responsible for rising temperatures by trapping heat in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere. The increasing amounts of atmospheric carbon is largely the result of burning fossil fuels, such as oil gas coal, to fuel the ever increasing demand for energy. As energy demand is often closely related to demographic and economic factors such as population and income, there is a good chance that many other variables share a relationship with the output of carbon emissions. This is important data because it is difficult to fight climate change and reduce carbon emissions without properly understanding which factors drive it.

### Description of the source of data:

The data source mostly came from the World Bank, UN and other credible sources where you can find datasets that can be integrated into most machine learning tools. For our topic we have to use sources that supply us with large amounts of data that have a big enough range for us to be able to make a hypothesis. We also want to use data that is formatted well and can be inputted into machine learning tools to help us prove our theory.

### Questions we hope to answer with the data:


### Which of the below variables researched or found have the most impact in contributing to Carbon Emissions?

- Life Expectancy
- GDP and GDP per capita

### Questions that will be answered?

Does the population size of a country add to carbon emissions?
How does the GDP affect carbon emissions?
What is the correlation between GDP per Capita and CO2 emissions?
Is there a correlation between life expectancy and CO2 emissions?
